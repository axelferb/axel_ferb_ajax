## `About`
Website that lists all launches made by spaceX aswell as giving you a basic overview aswell as the ability to get further statistics about additional launches.

## `Api information`
Used the [spaceX API avalible here on github](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/wiki). Gives you plenty of stuff to mess around with regarding informationn/videos etc.

## `Basic workprocess`
Started out with making a basic html/css layout. Then used that basic layout for pretty much the whole JS part of the site. last thing i did was to enhance the visuals a bit aswell as making it use localstorage.
### `Things i could improve!`
- Improve visuals, the site is rather dull to look at.
- Enable the user to sort by type of rocket aswell as latest/oldes launch at the SAME time, currently not a feature.
- Tidy the JS, i belive there are a few places where my code could improve aswell as minimize repetition.
